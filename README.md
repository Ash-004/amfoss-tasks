# About Me?
CSE 2022 Batch- Amritapuri 

Interests: Reading, Martial arts. Learning new stuff, r/FatFIRE :) , Travelling

I hate how I just cannot think of anything to write when I'm supposed to do an introduction ðŸ«£. Thats where I need you guys at AMFOSS. At the end of myfour year journey with amfoss I expect to miraculously be better at interacting with people and having done enough "computer stuff" to give me credibility wherever I go ;-; . The main reason I joined Amrita was the foss club ( if you overlook parents lowkey forcing me to as kollam was close enough for them "keep an eye on me" ðŸ’€). In my head, AMFOSS is something that will help me grow and learn a lot of skills, not just programming but maybe crucial things like teamwork, leadership skills and most importantly networking. 

Onto the tasks, to be frank they weren't all that hard. You just had to put in some work and BE CONSISTENT. That was something I lacked and I still do to an extent. I put in effort in small bursts so yea got to change that. Being a bio student I was stumped at first seeing how much the computer students already knew. Kinda made me regret my last two years of mugging up bio for marks ;-; . Anyways I got almost all of the tasks done without too much problem? I busted my head for like two weeks to complete the go wasm task and gave up at the end ðŸ˜­. Also the godot game I had had enough trouble with the flame game so I knew theres no way I'm completing that.

Anyways thats all for now I have spent more time on this than I'll admit. Got to go study for history exam.(Why do we even have history exams for an engineering course? ðŸ¤·)
