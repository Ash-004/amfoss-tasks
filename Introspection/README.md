## Why must we choose you? 

This is a section that dread writing about 😭. I am absolutely terrible at selling myself so here we go anwyays.
I won't say the usual stuff like Im extra super passionate about programming and stuff 🙄. I do like coding and have always loved problem solving. I think I have a competitive streak and I like learning new stuff.

## My plan for the next 6 months

I havent thought about what happens if I get into FOSS. I would just work along with everyone else and probably focus on competitive programming if I have the time after the club activites

If i dont get selected though, I would just do the usual thing, learn DSA and grind leetcode and cp 👩‍🦲

## How would I contribute back to the club?

Active participation in the club? I really dont have much knowledge about all that happens in the club so.. I will try to be as involved as possible. 🗿

## Feedback on the selection process.

Nothing much to say tbh. Can be completed with a bit of brains and a lot of googling and just by staying committed.
