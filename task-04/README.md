# Task-04 
## Johns Cinebot ðŸŽ¥
I'll admit, this task turned out to be pretty hard for me and oh boy did I know it just got harder from here on. Getting data from the api was the easy part, sending it as a chat along with the poster image took some reading to figure out. It took me some time to understand how to do the csv part and how to export it. This was a fun task though and I was super hyped when I finally got it running
