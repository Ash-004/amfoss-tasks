# Installing Linux

I already had PopOs dual booted on my laptop. Followed this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbzCSjlbInY) for the both times I did it. Yes, both. I wiped Pop to install arch ðŸ—¿(donot try this at home kids) and failed then went back to Pop again. Wont be trying again that for some time now ;-;
