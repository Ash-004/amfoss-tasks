# Task-06
## FlameGame 🐇

Probably one of the harder tasks. Watched a video on flame which didn't really help much. Heavily relied on an article so I would be lying if I say that I did all of this myself. 95% google and 5% me although I did try to understand how the code works at the end of it all . The 5% being me adding a few lines to see that the bunny didnt go out of the screen 💀.
